# social-media-service (SMS)
A social media API that allows users to profiles, post updates, follow other users, and interact with each other through comments and likes.

## SMS Solution design overview

Building a social media platform using Spring Boot can be a challenging and exciting project. Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can follow to implement the desired features:

* **Data Modeling**: Design the data models for your application. This might include entities like User, Profile, Post, Comment, Like, and any other related entities you may need. Consider the relationships between these entities.
* **User Management**: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. You can also include features like profile picture uploads and account settings.
* **Profile Management**: Create endpoints to handle profile-related operations. Users should be able to create and update their profiles, view other users' profiles, and follow/unfollow other users.
* **Post Management**: Implement functionality for users to create, edit, and delete posts. Allow users to upload images or videos as part of their posts. Users should be able to view and interact with posts from other users.
* **Commenting**: Enable users to comment on posts. Implement endpoints to handle commenting functionality, including creating comments, retrieving comments for a post, and deleting comments.
* **Likes and Interactions**: Implement functionality for users to like posts and view the number of likes a post has received. You can also include features like sharing posts or saving posts for later.
* **Feed and Timeline**: Build a feed or timeline feature that shows users the latest posts from the users they follow. Implement pagination and filtering options to enhance the user experience.
* **Notifications**: Implement a notification system to keep users informed about new followers, likes, comments, or mentions. Use WebSocket or real-time messaging technologies to provide instant updates.
* **Search and Discovery**: Enable users to search for other users, posts, or specific content using relevant keywords. Implement endpoints to handle search queries and provide relevant search results.
* **User Interface**: Develop a user interface for your social media platform. You can create a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Alternatively, you can create a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
* **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing in Spring Boot.
* **Deployment**: Deploy your application to a hosting platform or a cloud provider. You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deployment.

Remember to handle security aspects like user privacy, data protection, and secure communication. Also, consider implementing moderation features to prevent misuse or inappropriate content.

This outline should give you a starting point for developing your Social Media Platform. Be sure to explore the Spring Boot documentation for detailed implementation guidance. Good luck with your project!
